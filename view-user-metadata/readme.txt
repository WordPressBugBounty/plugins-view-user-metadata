A lightweight plugin that allows you to view user metadata, export them CSV or JSON, or delete key/value pairs.

== Description ==

Introducing our new lightweight WordPress plugin - View User Metadata!

https://youtu.be/LgWdTlLw8BQ

This plugin adds a simple toggle button to the user edit screen, allowing administrators to easily view metadata associated with the user they are currently viewing. Metadata includes all data attached to a user account. Administrator's can also delete the usermeta.

This plugin is perfect for developers where metadata is important to view but doesn't need to be displayed at all times.

Features:
- Toggle to show/hide user data
- Click-to-focus on any row
- Delete a key/value pair
